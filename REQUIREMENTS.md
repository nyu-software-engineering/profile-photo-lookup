# Profile Photo Lookup Requirements
The project aims to create a web application that allows reverse profile picture look-up using facial detection and recognition algorithm. The user will upload any picture that contain a human face, and our algorithm will try to match an existing face on social media profile picture, and provides a link to the social media.

## Requirements
Project requirements that we have in mind before starting. Subject to constant change at any stage of development.

### Function Requirements
1. Allow user to upload a picture
2. Return a link of social media to the user if the social media of the person is found
3. Allow any user to prohibit himself/herself from being search in social media


### Non-functioning Requirements
1. Time constraints - how long does it take to find the social media
2. Size constraints - how expensive to store huge amount of datasets
3. Privacy - how acceptable are people towards the idea of profile potentially being found by someone completely random
